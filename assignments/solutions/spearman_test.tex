\begin{solution}
    I have calculated the results for the Spearman Rank Correlation Test for the samples using the Value and Equal Weighted S\&P 500. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:value_table} and Table~\ref{tab:equal_table}, respectively. As we can see, there is evidence pointing for the presence of autocorrelation for the Equal Weighted returns for the whole sample. The Value Weighted returns, however, fail to present any autocorrelation in the first part of the sample. Therefore we may conclude that the autocorrelation may be driven by the small cap stocks which receive more weight on the equal weighted portfolio. For the absolute returns, the results show that there is significant autocorrelation for the whole sample for both portfolios. This is in lign with the literature of volatility clustering. \\
