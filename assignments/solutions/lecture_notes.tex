This problem asks you to provide proofs of some results that we cited in Lecture Notes 3.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide proofs for all the results not proven on pages 4-5 of Lecture Notes
    \item Provide the derivation for the optimal portfolio in the case where a risk-free asset is present on page 7 of Lecture Notes 3.
