\begin{solution}
    Let \(\wh\mu\) and \(\wt\mu\) be two consistent estimators of a parameter \(\mu\) in the real line. Assume that 
    \[
        \prob\bc{\wh\mu \neq \wt\mu} > 0
    \]
    (so they are not the same) and that \(\wh\mu\) is efficient (i.e., it has the smallest variance). Fix \(\lambda \in [0,1]\) and let \(\wt\mu(\lambda)\) be a convex combination between these two estimators:
    \[
        \bar\mu(\lambda) = \lambda \wh\mu + (1-\lambda) \wt\mu
    \]
    By definition it is also consistent and its variance is given by:
    \[
        \var{\bar\mu(\lambda)} = \lambda^2 \var{\wh\mu} + (1-\lambda)^2 \var{\wt\mu} + 2\lambda(1-\lambda)\cov{\wh\mu, \wt\mu}
    \]  
    Lets find the value of \(\lambda\) that minimizes the variance of \(\bar\mu(\lambda)\). The first order condition of the minimization of the equation above is:
    \[
        \frac{\partial \var{\bar\mu}}{\partial \lambda}(\lambda) = 2\lambda \var{\wh\mu} - 2(1-\lambda) \var{\wt\mu} + 2(1-2\lambda)\cov{\wh\mu, \wt\mu} = 0
    \]
    And the second order condition is:
    \[
        \frac{\partial^2 \var{\bar\mu}}{\partial \lambda^2}(\lambda) = 2 \var{\wh\mu} - 2 \var{\wt\mu} + - 4\cov{\wh\mu, \wt\mu} = 2\var{\wh\mu-\wt\mu}> 0
    \]
    where the strictly positivity follows from the fact that \(\wh\mu\) and \(\wt\mu\) are not the same estimate. \\
    These two conditions characteris a global minimizer \(\lambda^\ast\) of the variance of \(\bar\mu(\lambda)\). Since \(\wh\mu\) is efficient, it must be the case that \(\lambda^\ast = 1\). Therefore, from the FOC:
    \[
        \frac{\partial \var{\bar\mu}}{\partial \lambda}(1) = 2\var{\wh\mu} - 2\cov{\wh\mu, \wt\mu} = 0
    \]
    Therefore we get that:
    \[
        \var{\wh\mu} = \cov{\wh\mu, \wt\mu}
    \]
